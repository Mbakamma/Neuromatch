        "\n",
        "- Cognitive scientists use standard lab tests to tap into specific processes in the brain and behavior. Some examples of those tests are Stroop, N-back, Digit Span, TMT (Trail making tests), and WCST (Wisconsin Card Sorting Tests).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Despite an extensive body of research that explains human performance using descriptive what-models, we still need a more sophisticated approach to gain a better understanding of the underlying processes (i.e., a how-model).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Interestingly, many of such tests can be thought of as a continuous stream of stimuli and corresponding actions, that is in consonant with the RL formulation. In fact, RL itself is in part motivated by how the brain enables goal-directed behaviors using reward systems, making it a good choice to explain human performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- This project aims to use behavioral data to train an agent and then use the agent to investigate data produced by human subjects. Having a computational agent that mimics humans in such tests, we will be able to compare its mechanics with human data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In another conception, we could fit an agent that learns many cognitive tasks that require abstract-level constructs such as executive functions. This is a multi-task control problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "- One example would be the N-back task.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In the N-back, participants view a sequence of stimuli, one by one, and are asked to categorize each stimulus as being either target or non-target. Stimuli are usually numbers, and feedback is given at both timestep and trajectory levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The agent is rewarded when its response matches the stimulus that was shown N steps back in the episode. A simpler version of the N-back uses two-choice action schema, that is target vs non-target. Once the present stimulus matches the one presented N step back, then the agent is expected to respond to it as being a `target`.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Given a trained RL agent, we then find correlates of its fitted parameters with the brain mechanisms. The most straightforward composition could be the correlation of model parameters with the brain activities.\n",
