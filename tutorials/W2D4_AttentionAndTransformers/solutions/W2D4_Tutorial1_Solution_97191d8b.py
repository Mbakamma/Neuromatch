The problem here is that some words might be just more frequent than the others. The authors
of the CrowS-Pairs paper go futher and create a more sophisticated metric, however, in this
section for simplicity we computed raw probabilities. That is okay since we
intentionally chose the words that have roughly the same distribution.
