HINT:
Suppose you want to verify if your model is biased towards creatures who lived a long
time ago. So you make two almost identical sentences like this:

  The tigers are looking for their prey in the jungles.
  The compsognathus are looking for their prey in the jungles.

What do you think would be the probabilities of these sentences? What would be you
conclusion in this situation?
